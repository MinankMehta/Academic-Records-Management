# Academic-Records-Management
In this project we have created a academic records management system. There will be 3 type of users- Admin, Teacher, Student. Their information (email, password and type) would be stored in a databse named "userdata". 
The students after logging in will have option to choose branch, year and semester. After which the sunjects in that respective options would be displayed, clicking on respective subject will lead to a page having various academic record topics (IA sheets, ISE papers, etc). Clicking on the respective one will lead to the pdfs uploaded under that topic, students will have option to view and download them.
Teachers will have same facilities as student with some additional topics which maybe private to teachers only. They will also have the ability to upload PDFs and delete their uploaded pdfs.
Admin will have ability to modify data stored in userdata. They will also have ability to delete any PDFs uploaded by teachers.
